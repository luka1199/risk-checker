Thirdly, improved manure storage facilities, with proper flooring and covering, can prevent emissions to the surrounding environment. Fourth, improving pastures with plants that absorb more CO2 and recycling manure into energy could help reduce emissions. Finally, reducing the size of livestock can increase the quantity and quality of feed and health care and thus increase the productivity of individual animals.

Carbon offsetting has no direct impact on reducing CO2 emissions of your business operations, and is therefore not an alternative to CO2 reduction. It is an additional measure, intended for the emissions that are truly unavoidable. There are several initiatives and organizations that offer climate compensation (for example for air travel or electricity use).

          "body": "<p>Use the 'precautionary principle' as far as the environment is concerned. This means that if it is uncertain whether a business activity will have a negative impact on the environment, you still take preventive measures to prevent damage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Measure your impact on the environment with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.footprintcalculator.org\/\">the Ecological Footprint<\/a>. This footprint helps you to understand how much land is needed for the production of a particular product and compares the outcome with how much land is available in total. Taking into account your Ecological Footprint within your business processes is called 'Ecological accounting'. This<a href=\"http:\/\/www.globaldenso.com\/en\/csr\/environment_report\/management\/guideline\/index.html\"> <\/a>manual explains how ecological accounting works.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or use the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). With an LCA you measure the environmental impact of products over their entire life cycle, from raw material to the end of the life phase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, create an environmental impact assessment (EIA). This is mandatory for certain activities, depending on the country where you work. Consult <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eia.nl\/en\/countries\">the country profiles<\/a> of the Netherlands Commission for Environmental Impact Assessment to see under which circumstances an EIA is mandatory and what the EIA procedure entails in the country concerned. However, be aware that compliance with local legislation alone often does not provide sufficient protection for the local population and the environment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/standard\/60857.html\">ISO 14001<\/a> is an international standard for which you can be certified. The ISO 14001 certificate specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system and is linked to a location: each site must therefore be certified separately. You can find out which organization arranges and verifies environmental certification for each country on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/members.html\">the ISO website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, consider doing business in a circular way. In circular business models, recycling is included in the revenue model. This is good for the environment and leads to long-term cost savings. Have a look <a href=\"https:\/\/www.circulairondernemen.nl\/doe-mee\">here for more information and inspiration in the field of circular business<\/a>.<\/p>",

Companies, farmers, paramilitary groups, rebels, and sometimes state actors are responsible for these acts of violence.<\/p>\n\n                                      <p><strong>\n                                              Country:\n                                            <\/strong> Argentina<\/p>\n                  \n                    <div class=\"sources keep-together\">\n    <strong>Source(s):<\/strong>\n    <ul class=\"source-list\">\n            <li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalwitness.org\/en\/press-releases\/global-witness-reports-227-land-and-environmental-activists-murdered-single-year-worst-figure-record\/\" data-id=\"10852\" data-old-id=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Global Witness, Global Witness reports 227 land and environmental activists murdered in a single year, the worst figure on record, 2021<\/a><\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n  <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n              \n                              <div class=\"advice-button-wrapper\">\n                  <button class=\"btn-advice btn btn-primary btn-form\" data-theme-counter=\"2_1\">Advice<\/button>\n\n                                      <div class=\"advice\">\n                    <p>Be aware that the conflict and security situation in a country can change rapidly.

Enteric fermentation (gases released by cattle, sheep and goats during digestion) is the largest source of CH4 emissions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another cause for the large carbon footprint per calorie of meat compared to plant-based products, is the inefficient transformation of plant energy to animal energy. In other words: many plant-based calories (in feed) are lost in the process of meat production (growth of the animal). These calories are not consumed by humans, but they do add up to the environmental impact of meat products.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the extra transportation step needed to bring the feed to animals causes higher CO2-emissions than plant-based products, and lastly, meat processing - particularly from slaughterhouse effluent - causes greater emissions than the processing of most other products.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among all animal products, beef has the largest environmental impact, emitting around 5 times more GHGs per calorie than any other meat- or dairy category.

For all ruminants, improving the digestibility and energy value of feed can reduce gaseous emissions per unit of meat or milk. Secondly, improving animal health can reduce the intensity of emissions because a smaller group of healthy animals are more productive and therefore produce lower emissions per unit of meat\/milk. Thirdly, improved manure storage facilities, with proper flooring and covering, can prevent emissions to the surrounding environment. Fourth, improving pastures with plants that absorb more CO2 and recycling manure into energy could help reduce emissions. Finally, reducing the size of livestock can increase the quantity and quality of feed and health care and thus increase the productivity of individual animals. This can maintain the overall profitability of the farm while reducing absolute emissions and intensity of emissions.<\/p>\n                      <div class=\"sources keep-together\">\n    <strong>Source(s):<\/strong>\n    <ul class=\"source-list\">\n            <li><a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/af\/article\/9\/1\/69\/5173494\" data-id=\"9165\" data-old-id=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Grossi, G. et al., Livestock and climate change: impact of livestock on climate and mitigation strategies, 2019<\/a><\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n  <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n                                      <div class=\"advice\">\n                    <p>Climate change is one of the biggest challenges today, with extreme droughts, crop failures and migration flows as some of its effects. This has a direct impact on international supply chains. To minimize these effects, reducing CO2 emissions is crucial. Not only from your own corporate activities, but also from production sites in the supply chain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To gain insight in the impact of your business, calculate your CO2 emissions with a <a href=\"https:\/\/co2-compensatie.nl\/en\/\">CO2 calculator<\/a>.<strong> <\/strong>See also the <a href=\"https:\/\/ghgprotocol.org\/\">GHG Protocol<\/a> for tools and training. Reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by, for example:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Taking energy-saving measures. Examples of measures can be found on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rvo.nl\/onderwerpen\/duurzaam-ondernemen\/energie-besparen\/energiebesparing-industrie\">RVO.nl<\/a> and on the website of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klimaatplein.com\/5-stappenplan-naar-co2-neutraal-ondernemen\">klimaatplein<\/a>;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Switching to a sustainable energy supplier;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Reducing transport kilometers and using less polluting forms of transport;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Report your carbon footprint and target in your annual report and\/or via the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdp.net\/en\">Carbon Disclosure Project.<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, compensate for your CO2 emissions that are (for now) unavoidable. This is called \u2018carbon offsetting\u2019, and it means that you pay for your CO2 emissions. With that money, projects are funded that reduce CO2 emissions elsewhere. Carbon offsetting has no direct impact on reducing CO2 emissions of your business operations, and is therefore not an alternative to CO2 reduction. It is an additional measure, intended for the emissions that are truly unavoidable. There are several initiatives and organizations that offer climate compensation (for example for air travel or electricity use).

According to a study published in Science, the production of meat, aquaculture, eggs, and dairy uses around 83% of the world\u2019s farmland and contribute around 57% of food\u2019s different emissions, while it provides only 37% of our protein and 18% of our calories.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The large amounts of land needed to rear animals and to grow feed can cause deforestation. Moreover, habitat degradation can take place through overgrazing (which may cause desertification), or due to the use of manure. Acidification can occur trough the spread of ammonia into the groundwater. Lastly, manure can cause the spread residues of medication to the surroundings, and can lead to the transmission of diseases between production animals and wildlife.<\/p>\n\n                                      <p><strong>\n                                              Product:\n                                            <\/strong> Meat and meat preparations <\/p>\n                  \n                    <div class=\"sources keep-together\">\n    <strong>Source(s):<\/strong>\n    <ul class=\"source-list\">\n            <li><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40726-016-0037-1\" data-id=\"9166\" data-old-id=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Epps, A. et al., Antibiotic Residues in Animal Waste: Occurrence and Degradation in Conventional Agricultural Waste Management Practices, 2016<\/a><\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n  <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                              <div class=\"risk\">\n                  <p>Although causes for deforestation vary per region, the conversion of forest to agricultural lands is a major driver across the world.

The associated waste, including manure, has serious implications for water quality. Livestock excreta contain considerable quantities of nutrients, oxygen-depleting substances, and pathogens. In intensive farming systems, where livestock is concentrated in relatively small areas, the production of wastes tends to go beyond the buffering capacity of surrounding ecosystems, thereby polluting surface waters and groundwater.<\/p><p>In the last 20 years, a new class of agricultural pollutants has emerged in the form of veterinary medicines (antibiotics, vaccines, and growth hormones), which move from farms through water to ecosystems and drinking-water sources.<\/p>\n\n                                      <p><strong>\n                                              Product:\n                                            <\/strong> Meat and meat preparations <\/p>\n                  \n                    <div class=\"sources keep-together\">\n    <strong>Source(s):<\/strong>\n    <ul class=\"source-list\">\n            <li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fao.org\/3\/a-i7754e.pdf\" data-id=\"2027\" data-old-id=\"12876\" target=\"_blank\">FAO, Water pollution from agriculture: A global review, 2017<\/a><\/li>\n            <li><a href=\"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/360\/6392\/987.full.pdf\" data-id=\"2120\" data-old-id=\"13060\" target=\"_blank\">Poore, J. &amp; Nemecek, T., Reducing food\u2019s environmental impacts through producers and consumers, 2018<\/a><\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n  <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                              <div class=\"risk\">\n                  <p>Wastewater of slaughter houses contains high amounts of organic material.

Discharging this wastewater untreated contributes greatly to the degradation of the aquatic environment and the pollution of irrigation water.<\/p>\n\n                                      <p><strong>\n                                              Product:\n                                            <\/strong> Meat and meat preparations <\/p>\n                  \n                    <div class=\"sources keep-together\">\n    <strong>Source(s):<\/strong>\n    <ul class=\"source-list\">\n            <li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intechopen.com\/books\/physico-chemical-wastewater-treatment-and-resource-recovery\/slaughterhouse-wastewater-treatment-management-and-resource-recovery\" data-id=\"8150\" data-old-id=\"13648\" target=\"_blank\">IntechOpen, Slaughterhouse Wastewater: Treatment, Management and Resource Recovery, 2017<\/a><\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n  <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n              \n                              <div class=\"advice-button-wrapper\">\n                  <button class=\"btn-advice btn btn-primary btn-form\" data-theme-counter=\"4_4\">Advice<\/button>\n\n                                      <div class=\"advice\">\n                    <p>Manure management is one of the main concerns in livestock production.

This means that if it is uncertain whether a business activity will have a negative impact on the environment, you still take preventive measures to prevent damage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Measure your impact on the environment with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.footprintcalculator.org\/\">the Ecological Footprint<\/a>. This footprint helps you to understand how much land is needed for the production of a particular product and compares the outcome with how much land is available in total. Taking into account your Ecological Footprint within your business processes is called 'Ecological accounting'. This<a href=\"http:\/\/www.globaldenso.com\/en\/csr\/environment_report\/management\/guideline\/index.html\"> <\/a>manual explains how ecological accounting works.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or use the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). With an LCA you measure the environmental impact of products over their entire life cycle, from raw material to the end of the life phase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, create an environmental impact assessment (EIA). This is mandatory for certain activities, depending on the country where you work. Consult <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eia.nl\/en\/countries\">the country profiles<\/a> of the Netherlands Commission for Environmental Impact Assessment to see under which circumstances an EIA is mandatory and what the EIA procedure entails in the country concerned. However, be aware that compliance with local legislation alone often does not provide sufficient protection for the local population and the environment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/standard\/60857.html\">ISO 14001<\/a> is an international standard for which you can be certified. The ISO 14001 certificate specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system and is linked to a location: each site must therefore be certified separately. You can find out which organization arranges and verifies environmental certification for each country on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/members.html\">the ISO website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, consider doing business in a circular way. In circular business models, recycling is included in the revenue model. This is good for the environment and leads to long-term cost savings.

Companies are demanded to identify, prevent and reduce CSR risks in their supply chain; both upstream and downstream. This is also called 'due diligence' or 'CSR risk management' and can consist of the following steps: the formulation of a CSR strategy, mapping your value chain, performing a risk assessment and prioritizing the risks, collaborating with value chain partners to address risks, as well as monitoring and communicating about your policies and progress.&nbsp;Parts of CSR risk management are starting to get mandatory through legislation, differing per country. The <a href=\"https:\/\/corporatejustice.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">European Coalition for Corporate Justice<\/a> provides an overview of the status of relevant legislation&nbsp;in European countries. MVO Nederland, UPJ and AWE can help you further with the implementation of CSR risk management. Find more information about our organisations and the services we offer <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"aab606d9-706b-4758-aca0-8729a5dd305a\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mvorisicochecker.nl\/en\/about-us\">in this section.<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>OECD Guidelines and UN Guiding Principles as a basis<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The OECD Guidelines and the UN Guiding Principles are the most widely accepted international guidelines that explain to companies how to perform CSR due diligence in their value chains.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/mneguidelines.oecd.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises<\/a> (OECD guidelines) are endorsed by 35 governments worldwide and offer a framework for companies to deal with sustainability issues such as child labour, environment and corruption. These governments expect companies with international business activities to operate in accordance with them. The recommendations of the OECD guidelines apply where local rules and regulations, or enforcement of these, do not suffice. It is important that companies know the social and environmental risks in their value chain, and take mitigating measures. Stakeholders can report suspected violations of the OECD guidelines to the National Contact Point in their respective country.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ohchr.org\/Documents\/Publications\/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights<\/a>&nbsp;distinguish the state's duty to protect human rights, the responsibility of companies to respect human rights, as well as the provision of access to effective remedy. Based on these three pillars of the UNGPs, more than twenty national action plans on business and human rights (NAPs) have been developed so far.<\/p>\r\n",

For all ruminants, improving the digestibility and energy value of feed can reduce gaseous emissions per unit of meat or milk.

Thirdly, improved manure storage facilities, with proper flooring and covering, can prevent emissions to the surrounding environment. Fourth, improving pastures with plants that absorb more CO2 and recycling manure into energy could help reduce emissions. Finally, reducing the size of livestock can increase the quantity and quality of feed and health care and thus increase the productivity of individual animals.

This means that if it is uncertain whether a business activity will have a negative impact on the environment, you still take preventive measures to prevent damage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Measure your impact on the environment with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.footprintcalculator.org\/\">the Ecological Footprint<\/a>. This footprint helps you to understand how much land is needed for the production of a particular product and compares the outcome with how much land is available in total. Taking into account your Ecological Footprint within your business processes is called 'Ecological accounting'. This<a href=\"http:\/\/www.globaldenso.com\/en\/csr\/environment_report\/management\/guideline\/index.html\"> <\/a>manual explains how ecological accounting works.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or use the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). With an LCA you measure the environmental impact of products over their entire life cycle, from raw material to the end of the life phase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, create an environmental impact assessment (EIA). This is mandatory for certain activities, depending on the country where you work. Consult <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eia.nl\/en\/countries\">the country profiles<\/a> of the Netherlands Commission for Environmental Impact Assessment to see under which circumstances an EIA is mandatory and what the EIA procedure entails in the country concerned. However, be aware that compliance with local legislation alone often does not provide sufficient protection for the local population and the environment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/standard\/60857.html\">ISO 14001<\/a> is an international standard for which you can be certified. The ISO 14001 certificate specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system and is linked to a location: each site must therefore be certified separately. You can find out which organization arranges and verifies environmental certification for each country on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/members.html\">the ISO website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, consider doing business in a circular way. In circular business models, recycling is included in the revenue model. This is good for the environment and leads to long-term cost savings.

This is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csrcompass.com\/responsible-supply-chain-management\" target=\"_blank\">responsible supply chain management<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CSR Risk Check provides you with a list of potential CSR risks for a specific stage of your value chain.

For example, to identify the CSR risks of computers from China, please also fill out the CSR Check for batteries, chips and e-waste.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>CSR risks can also occur during the transportation of (semi-finished) products and raw materials. Consider, for example, pollution from ships or the labour conditions in that sector in certain countries.

In the CSR Risk Check, gender-neutral descriptions are used where possible in describing risks. If risks are relevant for both men and women, the most common or neutral terms are used. If risks are not applicable to both men and women, gender-specific terms will be used.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All companies and organisations are expected to abide local laws and regulations of the countries where their business takes place. If local laws are absent, inadequate, or not upheld, international guidelines such as the OECD Guidelines and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ilo.org\/global\/standards\/lang--en\/index.htm\">ILO conventions<\/a> are normative. This means that, despite all the present legislation on CSR issues in a given country (such as criminal environmental offenses or a ban on child labour), CSR risks still occur. Moreover, the CSR Risk Check does not provide information on the presence or absence of local laws and regulations, unless this creates specific CSR risks (e.g. law that facilitates discrimination or prohibits trade unions).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list of countries and territories that is used the CSR Risk Check is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/obp\/ui\/#search\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 3166<\/a> standard, which is based on the official list of country and territory names as defined by the United Nations Statistics Division.
