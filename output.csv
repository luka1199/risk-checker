This can lead to: acidification (acid rain), eutrophication (extreme algae growth), climate chang and affecting the ozone layer.
Turkey;Polymers of ethylene (in primary forms);Environment (13 risks);Air pollution;According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), this country suffers excessive air pollution.The annual average PM2.5 level here is higher than 35 ug/m3, which the WHO describes as the first intermediate target for countries. At this level, there is a 15% greater risk of long-term mortality than at the recommended maximum annual average of 10 ug/m3. This means your employees in these countries (depending on the precise work location) are likely to be exposed to air pollution, with illness and premature death as possible consequences.
Turkey;Polymers of ethylene (in primary forms);Environment (13 risks);Soil & (ground)water contamination;The production and processing of chemicals contributes to soil contamination. Industrial water pollution of the global chemicals sector is considered to be very serious. Wastewater treatment often does not remove all pollutants. Chemicals may be toxic to human beings and they may also be damaging to the environment through toxicity to animal and plant species. The origin of these chemical wastes varies greatly and depends on the local situation, but typically discarded chemicals, manufacturing by-products and waste solvents contribute to the waste stream.

Turkey;Polymers of styrene (in primary forms);Labour rights (13 risks);Freedom of association;In 2021, the Turkish government continued to severely restrict civil liberties and workers' freedoms and rights were relentlessly denied with police crackdowns on protests, while trade union leaders were arbitrarily arrested and their homes raided. Employers systematically cracked down on unions by firing workers who tried to organise, especially in the metal, glass, leather and plastics industries.
Turkey;Polymers of styrene (in primary forms);Labour rights (13 risks);Freedom of association;Turkey scores a 5 on the ITUC Global Rights Index (scale 1-5) for freedom of association and workers' rights, which stands for no guarantee of rights. Countries with the rating of 5 are the worst countries in the world to work in. While the legislation may spell out certain rights, workers have effectively no access to these rights and are therefore exposed to autocratic regimes and unfair labour practices. In 2019, this resulted in discrimination and dismissal of trade union employees. Trade union leaders were arrested and prosecuted.

Turkey;Polymers of styrene (in primary forms);Environment (13 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;Microplastics are near-indestructible in natural environments and enter the oceans through litter, when waste such as plastic bags, packaging and other convenience materials are discarded. The global release of microplastics into the ocean is estimated at around 1.5million tonnes per year. Cosmetic products like toothpaste and exfoliating creams contain microbeads which easily enter waterways as these products are washed off after use. Through waterways they end up in oceans.Small fish think that these microbeads and microplastics are food. According to research, some young fish even prefer tiny particles of plastic to their natural food source. Because fish cannot digest plastic they eventually starve to death before they can reproduce. Small fish are food for bigger animals such as other fish, birds and marine mammals so the microplastics end up in their foodchain as well.

Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Climate & energy;Methane (CH4) is 25 times as strong a greenhouse gas (GHG) as CO2. Enteric fermentation (gases released by cattle, sheep and goats during digestion) is the largest source of CH4 emissions.Another cause for the large carbon footprint per calorie of meat compared to plant-based products, is the inefficient transformation of plant energy to animal energy. In other words: many plant-based calories (in feed) are lost in the process of meat production (growth of the animal). These calories are not consumed by humans, but they do add up to the environmental impact of meat products.Moreover, the extra transportation step needed to bring the feed to animals causes higher CO2-emissions than plant-based products, and lastly, meat processing - particularly from slaughterhouse effluent - causes greater emissions than the processing of most other products.Among all animal products, beef has the largest environmental impact, emitting around 5 times more GHGs per calorie than any other meat- or dairy category. Yet, a study published in Science shows that even the least-impact animal products have a higher environmental impact than their plant-based (nutritional) equivalents.

Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;Clearance of forests for agriculture is a major cause of deforestation worldwide; the three most significant commodities in this regard are palm oil, soy and beef, which together accounted for an estimated 76% of the deforestation associated with agriculture between 1990 and 2008.The global production of both palm oil and soy beans have more than doubled since 2000; both requiring a lot of land. Factors underlying this growth are (among others) increased global meat consumption (soy serves mainly as animal feed) and the use of biofuels (palm oil and soy).
Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;The animal husbandry sector emerges as one of the most significant contributors to environmental problems, both on a local and global scale. According to a study published in Science, the production of meat, aquaculture, eggs, and dairy uses around 83% of the world’s farmland and contribute around 57% of food’s different emissions, while it provides only 37% of our protein and 18% of our calories.The large amounts of land needed to rear animals and to grow feed can cause deforestation. Moreover, habitat degradation can take place through overgrazing (which may cause desertification), or due to the use of manure. Acidification can occur trough the spread of ammonia into the groundwater. Lastly, manure can cause the spread residues of medication to the surroundings, and can lead to the transmission of diseases between production animals and wildlife.
Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;Although causes for deforestation vary per region, the conversion of forest to agricultural lands is a major driver across the world.

Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Water use & water availability;The global average water footprint of beef is 15,400 litre/kg. To illustrate: one kilo of beef equals 300 days of showering.The water footprint related to the animal feed takes by far the largest share (99%). The precise water footprint of beef strongly depends on the production system (grazing, mixed or industrial), the composition of the feed and the origin of the feed. Grazing systems are preferable over industrial production systems from a water resources point of view. <br /> <br /> The global water footprint of beef production in the period 1996-2005 was about 800 billion m3/yr, which was one third of the total water footprint of animal production in the world.

At this level, there is a 15% greater risk of long-term mortality than at the recommended maximum annual average of 10 ug/m3. This means your employees in these countries (depending on the precise work location) are likely to be exposed to air pollution, with illness and premature death as possible consequences.
Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Soil & (ground)water contamination;Livestock production accounts for 30 percent of the land surface of the planet, and 70 percent of all agricultural land. The livestock sector is one of the top three contributors to the most serious environmental problems, including water-quality degradation, at every scale from local to global.The livestock sector is growing and intensifying faster than crop production in almost all countries. The associated waste, including manure, has serious implications for water quality. Livestock excreta contain considerable quantities of nutrients, oxygen-depleting substances, and pathogens. In intensive farming systems, where livestock is concentrated in relatively small areas, the production of wastes tends to go beyond the buffering capacity of surrounding ecosystems, thereby polluting surface waters and groundwater.In the last 20 years, a new class of agricultural pollutants has emerged in the form of veterinary medicines (antibiotics, vaccines, and growth hormones), which move from farms through water to ecosystems and drinking-water sources.
Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Soil & (ground)water contamination;Wastewater of slaughter houses contains high amounts of organic material. Discharging organic matter into surface water, results in a reduction of the total oxygen content of the water, causing a reduction of organisms that need oxygen to survive. This polluting effect is known as biological oxygen demand (BOD). Wastewater from slaughterhouses and meat processing industries is extremely harmful to the environment. Discharging this wastewater untreated contributes greatly to the degradation of the aquatic environment and the pollution of irrigation water.

Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Land use & property rights;In some wood (products) producing areas, governments may grant forest concessions where communities have long-standing claims to the land, which can lead to clashes between logging companies and local and indigenous communities. Many of these clashes have threatened livelihoods and human rights. Even in cases where land tenure is recognized, there can be distributional inequities regarding gender and ethnicity within the community. Land tenure is an ongoing struggle in some countries and can be one of the most difficult issues to resolve.Forestry operations (logging and processing) should be mindful of tenure claims. Make sure to know and follow the applicable land tenure rights regime, which may include community-based forest management systems.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Freedom of association;Turkey scores a 5 on the ITUC Global Rights Index (scale 1-5) for freedom of association and workers' rights, which stands for no guarantee of rights. Countries with the rating of 5 are the worst countries in the world to work in. While the legislation may spell out certain rights, workers have effectively no access to these rights and are therefore exposed to autocratic regimes and unfair labour practices. In 2019, this resulted in discrimination and dismissal of trade union employees. Trade union leaders were arrested and prosecuted.

Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Climate & energy;Methane (CH4) is 25 times as strong a greenhouse gas (GHG) as CO2. Enteric fermentation (gases released by cattle, sheep and goats during digestion) is the largest source of CH4 emissions.Another cause for the large carbon footprint per calorie of meat compared to plant-based products, is the inefficient transformation of plant energy to animal energy. In other words: many plant-based calories (in feed) are lost in the process of meat production (growth of the animal). These calories are not consumed by humans, but they do add up to the environmental impact of meat products.Moreover, the extra transportation step needed to bring the feed to animals causes higher CO2-emissions than plant-based products, and lastly, meat processing - particularly from slaughterhouse effluent - causes greater emissions than the processing of most other products.Among all animal products, beef has the largest environmental impact, emitting around 5 times more GHGs per calorie than any other meat- or dairy category. Yet, a study published in Science shows that even the least-impact animal products have a higher environmental impact than their plant-based (nutritional) equivalents.

Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;Clearance of forests for agriculture is a major cause of deforestation worldwide; the three most significant commodities in this regard are palm oil, soy and beef, which together accounted for an estimated 76% of the deforestation associated with agriculture between 1990 and 2008.The global production of both palm oil and soy beans have more than doubled since 2000; both requiring a lot of land. Factors underlying this growth are (among others) increased global meat consumption (soy serves mainly as animal feed) and the use of biofuels (palm oil and soy).
Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;The animal husbandry sector emerges as one of the most significant contributors to environmental problems, both on a local and global scale. According to a study published in Science, the production of meat, aquaculture, eggs, and dairy uses around 83% of the world’s farmland and contribute around 57% of food’s different emissions, while it provides only 37% of our protein and 18% of our calories.The large amounts of land needed to rear animals and to grow feed can cause deforestation. Moreover, habitat degradation can take place through overgrazing (which may cause desertification), or due to the use of manure. Acidification can occur trough the spread of ammonia into the groundwater. Lastly, manure can cause the spread residues of medication to the surroundings, and can lead to the transmission of diseases between production animals and wildlife.
Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;Although causes for deforestation vary per region, the conversion of forest to agricultural lands is a major driver across the world.

Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Water use & water availability;The global average water footprint of beef is 15,400 litre/kg. To illustrate: one kilo of beef equals 300 days of showering.The water footprint related to the animal feed takes by far the largest share (99%). The precise water footprint of beef strongly depends on the production system (grazing, mixed or industrial), the composition of the feed and the origin of the feed. Grazing systems are preferable over industrial production systems from a water resources point of view. <br /> <br /> The global water footprint of beef production in the period 1996-2005 was about 800 billion m3/yr, which was one third of the total water footprint of animal production in the world.

Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Soil & (ground)water contamination;Livestock production accounts for 30 percent of the land surface of the planet, and 70 percent of all agricultural land. The livestock sector is one of the top three contributors to the most serious environmental problems, including water-quality degradation, at every scale from local to global.The livestock sector is growing and intensifying faster than crop production in almost all countries. The associated waste, including manure, has serious implications for water quality. Livestock excreta contain considerable quantities of nutrients, oxygen-depleting substances, and pathogens. In intensive farming systems, where livestock is concentrated in relatively small areas, the production of wastes tends to go beyond the buffering capacity of surrounding ecosystems, thereby polluting surface waters and groundwater.In the last 20 years, a new class of agricultural pollutants has emerged in the form of veterinary medicines (antibiotics, vaccines, and growth hormones), which move from farms through water to ecosystems and drinking-water sources.

Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Environment & waste (general);Meat and dairy products have the largest negative environmental impact, in comparison with other food product groups. The use of cows, pigs, and other animals for food, as well as livestock feed, is responsible for 57% of all food production emissions.
Turkey;Meat of bovine animals (fresh, chilled or frozen);Environment (16 risks);Environment & waste (general);Urbanization in Turkey has led to uncontrolled waste dumping. Due to inadequate infrastructure for disposal of industrial waste (half of it dangerous waste) and only one available incinerator for dangerous waste, the majority is disposed of by municipalities. This creates severe pollution (through, among others, toxic substances or heavy metals) of garbage dumps and other dumpsites.Furthermore, the import of plastic waste from the UK is increasing according to the Guardian. Turkey recycles just 1% of its domestic waste, sending the rest to landfill.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Fair business practices (3 risks);Taxation;According to OECD, Turkey is only partially compliant with the international standard of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes. This means that Turkey could be seen as a ‘tax haven’.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Fair business practices (3 risks);Corruption;According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, the corruption score of Turkey is 38, on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). This means that the risk of corruption in Turkey is high.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Fair business practices (3 risks);Corruption;Corruption may occur regularly in Turkey in governmental organizations and business partners, for instance paying bribes, reducing import charges or falsifying official documents. Especially in customs corruption plays a role, but also labour inspectors are supposedly easily bribed. Additionally, when competing for public tenders you may be confronted with corruption.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Government influence;Turkey is considered to be "not free" according to the Freedom House Country List. This means that there is an oppressive regime, with regard to political rights and civil liberties.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Government influence;Turkey's press freedom is poor: it is becoming increasingly difficult for journalists to work freely, they are imprisoned or have their property taken away. There is no guarantee of a fair trial. Maintaining the independence of the press is made more difficult by the Turkish government. Also, a new law seems to restrict freedom of expression on social media.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Government influence;Turkey is ranked 149 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index with a score of 41.25 on a scale from 0 (worst possible score) and 100 (best possible score). This means that press freedom is limited.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Government influence;Turkey is ranked 117<sup>th</sup> out of 139 countries in the Rule of Law Index with a score of 0.42 on a scale from 0 (worst possible score) and 1 (best possible score). This means that this country performs poorly in the areas of corruption, openness of government and enforcement of regulations around rights, order, security, civil and criminal law.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Government influence;The number of journalists jailed globally because of their work hit a new high in 2020 as governments cracked down on coverage of COVID-19 or tried to suppress reporting on political unrest.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Conflicts & security;The score of Turkey on the Global Peace Index is 2.785 out of 5, which means it scores low in the areas of (inter)national conflict, societal security and militarization.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Conflicts & security;This country is marked as a 'high risk' country for terrorist attacks and political violence on the Aon Terrorism &amp; Political Violence Risk Map. It is considered as level 4 on a 1-5 scale.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Human rights & ethics (8 risks);Land use & property rights;In some wood (products) producing areas, governments may grant forest concessions where communities have long-standing claims to the land, which can lead to clashes between logging companies and local and indigenous communities. Many of these clashes have threatened livelihoods and human rights. Even in cases where land tenure is recognized, there can be distributional inequities regarding gender and ethnicity within the community. Land tenure is an ongoing struggle in some countries and can be one of the most difficult issues to resolve.Forestry operations (logging and processing) should be mindful of tenure claims. Make sure to know and follow the applicable land tenure rights regime, which may include community-based forest management systems.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Freedom of association;Turkey scores a 5 on the ITUC Global Rights Index (scale 1-5) for freedom of association and workers' rights, which stands for no guarantee of rights. Countries with the rating of 5 are the worst countries in the world to work in. While the legislation may spell out certain rights, workers have effectively no access to these rights and are therefore exposed to autocratic regimes and unfair labour practices. In 2019, this resulted in discrimination and dismissal of trade union employees. Trade union leaders were arrested and prosecuted.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Freedom of association;According to the ITUC Global Rights Index, MENA countries receive a score of 4.5 (a score of 5 means there are no workers' rights). 94 percent of the countries violated the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining. All 18 countries excluded workers from the right to form and join a union. 83 percent of countries in the Middle East and North Africa denied workers access to justice. All 18 countries obstructed the registration of trade unions. 44 percent of countries arrested and detained workers and workers were subjected to violent attacks. 83 percent of countries in the Middle East and North Africa restricted freedom of speech and assembly.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Forced labour & human trafficking;More than a million Syrian refugees are in Turkey without documents. This makes them vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking. Syrian refugees (including children) are forced to beg on the streets, work in restaurants, textile factories, markets, in shops, blacksmith shops and agriculture in Turkey.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Child labour;Thousands of Syrian children who fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey due to the war, are working. They often work in agriculture, the construction sector or in small shops. Almost 60% of the children interviewed by Terre des Hommes indicated that they work more than 7 hours per day, and a third of the children works 7 days per week.In this way, they try to provide for their families, or are themselves breadwinners. Many are exposed to pesticides, toxic chemicals, heavy loads and exhausting hours.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Discrimination & gender;While women enjoy the same rights as men by law, societal and official discrimination are widespread. Women face discrimination in employment.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Discrimination & gender;There are strong signals that persistent discrimination, impunity for violence, and lack of legal recognition and protection for LGBT people in Turkey remains a problem.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Discrimination & gender;In recent years, the state of religious freedom in Turkey has worsened. The Turkish government has indiscriminately designated those affiliated with Muhammed Fethullah Gülen (Gülen movement) as part of a terrorist organization. Government officials also engage in anti-Semitism in the form of public statements and comments made on social media platforms, while progovernment newspapers and media outlets propagated hate speech directed against both Christians and Jews.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Discrimination & gender;Women are economically and socially disadvantaged. Non-Sunni and non-Islamic religions have no legally secured status.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Wage & remuneration;Syrian refugees in Turkey do not earn the same salaries as Turkish employees and are paid far below the minimum wage. As a result, children have to work in order to support their family in terms of food.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Labour rights (10 risks);Health & safety at work;Dioxins are unwanted by-products of a wide range of manufacturing processes, including chlorine bleaching of paper pulp. Dioxins are highly toxic and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and cause cancer. Workers in the pulp and paper industry may be exposed to above-average levels of dioxins.

Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;Large areas, including forests are cut down for the production of paper products.Deforestation has serious consequences for the natural environment, such as loss of biodiversity and valuable natural areas. Also local residents often do not benefit from deforestation.<br />Forests also have an important role in global climate control, because they absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide. This feature disappears when the trees are felled or burned.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;The forest practices associated with some pulp and paper operations have had devastating impacts on some of the world’s most ecologically important places and species. Unsustainable pulp and paper operations have contributed to conversion of high conservation value forests, illegal harvesting, human rights and social conflicts, and irresponsible plantation development.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;Industrial pollution, Construction of dams and power plants, the use of pesticides, excessive grazing and forest fires have a very negative influence on the Turkish flora and fauna. In practice, international treaties on the area of nature protection and biodiversity are not properly complied with. Turkish forests are under heavy pressure by illegal logging, illegal construction and livestock farming. Also forest fires are intentionally started to use the land for construction and tourism.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Water use & water availability;For the production of paper and cardboard, large amounts of water are used. Waste water must be cleaned by the factory itself, or (after discharge) by a wastewater treatment facility. In addition to organic materials, such as starch, also residual chemicals and printing ink must be removed.<br />
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Water use & water availability;The production process of paper is very energy and water intensive in terms of the fresh water utilization.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Water use & water availability;Turkey faces moderate to severe freshwater scarcity in the spring-summer period.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Air pollution;According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), this country suffers excessive air pollution.The annual average PM2.5 level here is higher than 35 ug/m3, which the WHO describes as the first intermediate target for countries. At this level, there is a 15% greater risk of long-term mortality than at the recommended maximum annual average of 10 ug/m3. This means your employees in these countries (depending on the precise work location) are likely to be exposed to air pollution, with illness and premature death as possible consequences.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Soil & (ground)water contamination;By the production of paper and board, emissions are released into the water, in particular chlorine (glass), and chlorine compounds. These substances are used in the bleaching of paper. Persistent and toxic substances such as dioxins, can be formed afterwards in the waste water. The toxics end up in fishes.If the substance of phosphorus is released into the water during the production, this has an eutrophying effect on the water. That means that the water will contain more nutritients. This can lead to rapid growth / proliferation of some species (eg. algal blooms, occurrence of botulism).
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Soil & (ground)water contamination;Water sources and rivers in Turkey are becoming polluted by urbanisation, industrialisation and the use of chemicals in agriculture.
Turkey;Articles of paper and paperboard (including diapers);Environment (13 risks);Environment & waste (general);Paper that is not produced in Western Europe, is often bleached.

Taiwan;Polymers of styrene (in primary forms);Environment (8 risks);Biodiversity & deforestation;Microplastics are near-indestructible in natural environments and enter the oceans through litter, when waste such as plastic bags, packaging and other convenience materials are discarded. The global release of microplastics into the ocean is estimated at around 1.5million tonnes per year. Cosmetic products like toothpaste and exfoliating creams contain microbeads which easily enter waterways as these products are washed off after use. Through waterways they end up in oceans.Small fish think that these microbeads and microplastics are food. According to research, some young fish even prefer tiny particles of plastic to their natural food source. Because fish cannot digest plastic they eventually starve to death before they can reproduce. Small fish are food for bigger animals such as other fish, birds and marine mammals so the microplastics end up in their foodchain as well.
Taiwan;Polymers of styrene (in primary forms);Environment (8 risks);Water use & water availability;In all OECD countries the chemical manufacturing industry is the largest single consumer of water by sector.
